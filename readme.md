The intention behind this program was to fix a problem I found when working with Opensong
(http://www.opensong.org/) that does not index files with tildes in order, so instead of 
going through each file, one by one (there are more tha 200), I coded the solution in C++.

The test songs used for test can be downloaded from <a href="http://iglesiamaranata.es/alabanza-y-proyeccion/" target="blank"> iglesia maranata </a>

I hope it is useful for anybody!
